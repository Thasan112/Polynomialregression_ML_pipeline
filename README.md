# Polynomialregression_ML_pipeline
This project demonstrates how **Linear Regression** can underfit nonlinear data and how **Polynomial Regression** can improve the fit.   A synthetic quadratic dataset is generated, and different regression models are compared using **RÂ² score** and visualizations.
